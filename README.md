# Luna's Adblock List

This is my custom adblock filter list.

## How to Use

To add this list to your ad blocker:

1.  Copy the following URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luna-Moon21/adblock-filters/refs/heads/main/Luna-Filters.txt
2.  In uBlock Origin, go to "Settings" -> "Filter lists" -> "Custom" -> "Import" and paste the URL.
3.  In AdGuard, go to "Filters" -> "User filters" -> "Add a custom filter" and paste the URL.

Enjoy!
